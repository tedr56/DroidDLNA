DroidDLNA is a full featured android DLNA App, with support of  UPnP/DLNA Control Point, UPnP Media Renderer and UPnP Media Server.
This app is based on Cling 2.0 alpha1, Cling is a UPnP-compatible software stack for Java environments.

Play easily your music, videos and images on your phone and devices on your network (DLNA TVs, XBMC, WMP, ...), 
from your external UPnP Media Servers. Play your phone/tablet media to those devices.

This code was mainly developed in 2013-2014, now I decide open source it in 2015. 

I hope it will be helpful if you are developping DLNA/UPNP apps. 
I will upgrade it to support Android 5 and the latest release of Cling 2.0.1 in future. 
Have a good Day!
